My family is really rich. But nobody knows.
Reason is that they have always lived frugally, buying, eating and using the cheapest.
I estimate our net worth at a few millions dollar, yet, except maybe one of my friend 
that suspect it, nobody knows how rich we are. 
My dad is working as an engineer for an average salary (around 5000$/month) which makes it even less obvious.
How come I know? Well it¡¯s pretty easy to know once 
you have a list of all the houses and appartments you own.
?It's a sanitary liner. In other words, what many women use to catch blood when they have their periods.
Well. I had a friend who worked as a flight attendant and she got into a mild argument with a guy who insisted 
on having EVERYTHING that was free or complimentary on the flight. He was highly annoying and constantly asked
crew for stuff. If he saw someone next to him get something, he wanted it too. 
At one point during the flight a lady asked for a sanitary pad to help her with
an 'emergency' situation. He insisted he should have one too - cos you know, it's free, right?
My friend tried to reason with him. I'm not sure if his English was 100%,
 because he insisted again and seemed to assume the pad was one of these...
